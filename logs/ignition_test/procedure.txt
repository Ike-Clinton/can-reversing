NOTE: These tests were performed with the following procedure:

1. Start a candump log on a quiet CAN bus "candump -l ...."
2. Start a stopwatch
3. Immediately insert key into ignition and turn, starting vehicle
4. Once the stopwatch hits 5 seconds, hit control+c to stop logging
5. Turn off car, allow bus to become quiet again
6. Log files are named run_#_5s.log where # is the number of test runs
In this case we performed 10 runs of this sequence.
